proper start / stop, kill master + child

what is the correct supervisor start mechanism/command?

2 steps:

command in puppet to master process start/stop

2 scripts -

start UPGRADE=1 (does sighup)
stop UPGRADE=1

status passthrough to supervisor?

more env in the start/stop


-----

uDeploy
- want sudo or group or other fix to udeploy vs uber users. this is killer. (common group=dply, at a minimum?)
- explicit control from UI over rollback; default to rollback upgrade, but upgrade between rolling/non-rolling releases may always need a real stop/start.
- puppet standardizing
- what is 'status' supposed to do after UPGRADE=1 stop?

moving to systemd instead of supervisord
use cases for various workers, what breaks

status during UPGRADE=true

Handoff
- rewrite to explicit FD instead of nodejs/cluster
- write template/doc on how to actually do this.
